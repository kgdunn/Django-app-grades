<h2>Updates to grades</h2>
<ul><li>All grades are now posted. Thanks again for the consistent hard work on all assignments, tutorials, tests and exams. 
Enjoy the holidays and good luck for the rest of your courses.</li>
    <li>The final exam was graded out of 90 to account for the lack of time that some students experienced. </li>
    <li>I know this is short notice, but please bring any serious discrepancy to my attention before 15:00 on 23 December; after that 
it is much harder to make changes.</li>
